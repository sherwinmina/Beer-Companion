      <h4>Guide about hops and Brewing</h4>
      <h5>Chemical composition</h5>
      <p>
        In addition to water, cellulose, and various proteins, the chemical
        composition of hops consists of compounds important for imparting
        character to beer.
      </p>
      <h5>Alpha acids</h5>
      <p>
        Probably the most important chemical compound within hops are the
        alpha acids or humulones. During wort boiling, the humulones are
        thermally isomerized into iso-alpha acids or isohumulones, which are
        responsible for the bitter taste of beer
      </p>
      <h5>Beta acids</h5>
      <p>
        Hops contain beta acids or lupulones sensitive to oxidative
        decomposition which may be detrimental to the taste of beer. For this
        reason, beta acids are considered a negative factor in brewing and
        many brewers usually choose hops with a low beta acid content.[32]
      </p>
      <h5>Essential oils</h5>
      <p>
        The main components of hops essential oils are terpene hydrocarbons
        consisting of myrcene, humulene and caryophyllene.[31] Myrcene is
        responsible for the pungent smell of fresh hops. Humulene and its
        oxidative reaction products may give beer its prominent hop aroma.
        Together, myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene represent 80 to 90% of
        the total hops essential oil.[31]
      </p>
      <h5>Flavonoids</h5>
      <p>
        Xanthohumol is the principal flavonoid in hops. The other well-studied
        prenylflavonoids are 8-prenylnaringenin and isoxanthohumol.
        Xanthohumol is under basic research for its potential properties,
        while 8-prenylnaringenin is a potent phytoestrogen.[33][34]

      <h4>Brewing</h4>
      <p>
        Hops are usually dried in an oast house before they are used in the
        brewing process.[35] Undried or "wet" hops are sometimes (since
        ca.1990) used.[36][37] The wort (sugar-rich liquid produced from malt)
        is boiled with hops before it is cooled down and yeast is added, to
        start fermentation. The effect of hops on the finished beer varies by
        type and use, though there are two main hop types: bittering and
        aroma.[2] Bittering hops have higher concentrations of alpha acids,
        and are responsible for the large majority of the bitter flavor of a
        beer. European (so-called "noble") hops typically average 5–9% alpha
        acids by weight (AABW), and the newer American cultivars typically
        range from 8–19% AABW. Aroma hops usually have a lower concentration
        of alpha acids (~5%) and are the primary contributors of hop aroma and
        (nonbitter) flavor. Bittering hops are boiled for a longer period of
        time, typically 60–90 minutes, to maximize the isomerization of the
        alpha acids. They often have inferior aromatic properties, as the
        aromatic compounds evaporate off during the boil. The degree of
        bitterness imparted by hops depends on the degree to which alpha acids
        are isomerized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of
        hops is specified in International Bitterness Units. Unboiled hops are
        only mildly bitter. On the other hand, the nonbitter flavor and aroma
        of hops come from the essential oils, which evaporate during the boil.
        Aroma hops are typically added to the wort later to prevent the
        evaporation of the essential oils, to impart "hop taste" (if during
        the final 30 minutes of boil) or "hop aroma" (if during the final 10
        minutes, or less, of boil). Aroma hops are often added after the wort
        has cooled and while the beer ferments, a technique known as "dry
        hopping", which contributes to the hop aroma. Farnesene is a major
        component in some hops.[2] The composition of hop essential oils can
        differ between varieties and between years in the same variety, having
        a significant influence on flavor and aroma.[2] Today, a substantial
        amount of "dual-use" hops are used, as well. These have high
        concentrations of alpha acids and good aromatic properties. These can
        be added to the boil at any time, depending on the desired effect.[38]
        Hop acids also contribute to and stabilize the foam qualities of
        beer.[2] Flavors and aromas are described appreciatively using terms
        which include "grassy", "floral", "citrus", "spicy", "piney",
        "lemony", "grapefruit", and "earthy".[2][39] Many pale lagers have
        fairly low hop influence, while lagers marketed as Pilsener or brewed
        in the Czech Republic may have noticeable noble hop aroma. Certain
        ales (particularly the highly hopped style known as India Pale Ale, or
        IPA) can have high levels of hop bitterness. Brewers may use software
        tools to control the bittering levels in the boil and adjust recipes
        to account for a change in the hop bill or seasonal variations in the
        crop that may lead to the need to compensate for a difference in alpha
        acid contribution. Data may be shared with other brewers via BeerXML
        allowing the reproduction of a recipe allowing for differences in hop
        availability.
