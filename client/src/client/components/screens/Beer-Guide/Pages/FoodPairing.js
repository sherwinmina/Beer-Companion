            F or centuries, if you asked a restaurant server in any
            mid-range to upscale American eatery what drink to pair with a
            certain dish, he'd bring over the sommelier and a wine bottle
            negotiation would ensue. But in the last five years, there's
            been a paradigm shift: Beer has made it onto the menu as more
            than an afterthought. Beverage directors, chefs, and even wine
            lovers have learned that beer has an amazing capacity to pair
            with all kinds of foods. As a result, beer sommeliers have
            popped up in cities across the country, especially Los Angeles,
            Chicago, New York, and Portland, Oregon. Beer-and-food tasting
            events have multiplied exponentially—the monthly lists at
            beerfestivals.org are enormous. Nowadays, asking for a beer no
            longer means you're simply afraid of wine (or the type of person
            who wears face paint to football games). Beer may actually be
            more food-friendly than wine is. There is certainly more room
            for flavor variety. Winemakers, after all, have one ingredient
            to play with: grapes. Two, if you count wood barrel–aging.
            Beermakers, on the other hand, can experiment with barley (which
            adds sweetness), hops (which provide bitterness), yeast (which
            lend that characteristic "bready" flavor), as well as spices,
            nuts, chocolate, fruits, and vegetables. You have tried
            framboise (raspberry) and pumpkin beer, right? Even the world's
            greatest experimental chef, elBulli's Ferran Adrià, believes in
            beer's flavor-matching prowess: He recently released Estrella
            Damm Inedit (made with barley, malt, wheat, hops, coriander,
            orange peel, licorice, yeast, and water), specifically created
            to be food-friendly.

          <h4>food and beer pairing issues:</h4>
          <h5>Complementary or contrasting flavors?</h5>
          <p>
            Some chefs and sommeliers attempt to find commonalities,
            pairing, say, a spicy Thai dish with a spicy pale ale (could
            also be a fruit-fruit or chocolate-chocolate synchronization,
            etc.). The idea is that there is a pleasant echo. Notes in one
            sip evoke flavors in past or future bites. The opposite approach
            suggests that contrasting flavors are pleasing in a ying-yang
            sort of way: A dry, bitter stout classically pairs with oysters,
            perhaps "cutting through" the sweetness of the shellfish. Sweet
            and salty always work wonders. Remember that dominant food
            flavors can come from the protein (like beef), the sauce (such
            as a cream sauce), or the method of preparation (grilling, for
            example).
          </p>
          <h5>Comparing to Wine</h5>
          <p>
            Some people say lager is like white wine and ale is like red. A
            corollary of that concept: that beer hops (as in a nice bitter
            IPA) function like wine acids (found in, say, a Sauvignon Blanc
            or a Chianti) in food pairings. Both cut through fattiness and
            oiliness, and even saltiness. Imagine them both as providing the
            lemon in, or acid counterpoint to, a fish dish. These are
            oversimplifications, but there are a few fundamental differences
            between lager and ale (the two main types of beer) worth
            contemplating: Ales tend to be fruity and robust, while lagers
            are crisp and comparatively delicate. In terms of body, there
            are three types of beer (like wine): light, medium, and heavy.
            Generally you can pair light dishes with light beer and heavy
            dishes with heavy beer. Examples: Light Body Wines: Sauvignon
            Blanc, Pinot Noir, Barbera, Pinot Grigio Beers: Lager, Pilsner,
            Wheat Medium Body Wines: Merlot, Zinfandel, Syrah Beers: Ale,
            IPA, Bock Heavy Body Wines: Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Oaky
            Chardonnay Beers: Stout, Porter, Barleywine
          </p>
          <h5>Texture, Temperature and Timing</h5>
          <p>
            Bubbles cut through fried and fatty foods, so opt for more
            carbonization when eating richer foods. Pizza, for example, is a
            greasy match made in heaven and requires something that will
            stand up to the acids in the tomato and cut through the fatty
            cheese but not overwhelm the dish. Stouts and porters are too
            heavy. Wheat beers might be a little light or fruity. Ales,
            pilsners, and lagers are your best bet: Hops stand up to the
            cheese, while bubbles cleanse the palate. Note that beer can
            taste syrupy if it's too warm. It's best served between 40°F and
            50°F. (Note: some fridges get even colder than 40°F, so you
            might consider leaving a beer out for 15 minutes before
            serving.). Finally, timing really is everything. If you're
            pairing a whole meal with different beers, course by course,
            dish by dish, make sure to start with a light beer and work your
            way toward darker beers. If you don't, you may overwhelm your
            palate early on and miss some of the subtler notes and aromas of
            delicate beers.

          <h5>Beware of simply matching the region</h5>
          <p>
            Many people think if you're having Mexican food, it's a safe bet
            that a Mexican beer will pair well. The truth is: Most
            restaurants offer only a small selection of beers and mostly
            because that's what people are used to seeing on a menu. Mexican
            Tecate, Thai Singha, Indian Kingfisher, and Chinese Tsingtao are
            all great European pilsner-style beers, but they're not
            universal pairing solutions for all dishes from their respective
            countries. (Some of these brands are actually brewed in the U.S.
            or Canada anyway.) Beer experts advocate stronger and fruitier
            flavors when dining on spicy fare: ales, Hefeweizens, and wheat
            beers in particular. No matter what type of beer you choose, the
            coldness will feel good against hot food.
