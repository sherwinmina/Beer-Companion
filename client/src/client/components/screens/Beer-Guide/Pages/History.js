        <h4>Beer</h4>

        <p>
          Beer style is a term used to differentiate and categorize beers by
          factors such as colour, flavour, strength, ingredients, production
          method, recipe, history, or origin. The modern concept of beer style
          is largely based on the work of writer Michael Jackson in his 1977
          book The World Guide To Beer in which he categorised beers from
          around the world into style groups according to local customs and
          names.[1] In 1989, Fred Eckhardt furthered Jackson's work publishing
          The Essentials of Beer Style.[2] Although the systematic study of
          beer styles is a modern phenomenon, the practice of distinguishing
          between different varieties of beer is ancient, dating to at least
          2000 BC. The study of what constitutes a beer's style may involve
          provenance,[3] local tradition,[4] ingredients,[5] and/or empirical
          impression, which is conventionally broken down into several
          elements; typically - aroma, appearance, flavour and mouthfeel.[6]
          The flavour may include the degree of bitterness of a beer due to
          bittering agents such as hops, roasted barley, or herbs; and the
          sweetness from the sugar present in the beer.

        <h5>Types</h5>
        <p>
          Styles of beer go back at least to Mesopotamia. The Alulu Tablet, a
          Sumerian receipt for "best" ale written in Cuneiform found in Ur,
          suggests that even in 2050 BC there was a differentiation between at
          least two different types or qualities of ale. The work of Bedrich
          Hrozny on translating Assyrian merchants' tablets found in Hattusa,
          revealed that approximately 500 years later the Hittites had over 15
          different types of beer. Documents reveal comments on different
          local brewing methods or ingredients. Pliny the Elder in his
          Naturalis Historia wrote about Celts brewing ale "in Gaul and Spain
          in a number of different ways, and under a number of different
          names; although the principle is the same." Anglo-Saxon laws reveal
          they identified three different ales, while the Normans mention
          cervisae (ale) and plena cervisia (full bodied ale) in the Domesday
          Book. By the 15th century brewers in Germany and the Low Countries
          were using hops to flavour and preserve their ale; this new style of
          ale was called beer. When this trend came to Britain and brewers of
          beer in Southwark, London, started to take sales away from the
          traditional brewers of unhopped ale, there were complaints and
          protests. Laws were passed favouring either beer or ale for a number
          of years, until hopped beer became the standard style throughout
          Europe. At the same time, brewers in Bavaria were storing beer in
          cool caves during the summer months in order to stop it spoiling.
          The beer became known as lager from the German word lagern, meaning
          "to store". Although beers using naturally dried malt would have
          been pale-coloured, by the 17th century most malts in Europe would
          have been dried over a fire, resulting in a dark coloured beer. When
          coke started to be used for roasting malt in 1642, the resulting
          lighter coloured beers became very popular. By 1703 the term pale
          ale was starting to be used, though the beer it described was a
          lightly hopped ale, very different from more bitter modern versions.
          However, despite an awareness by commentators, law-makers, and
          brewers that there were different styles of beer, it wasn't until
          Michael Jackson's World Guide To Beer was published in 1977 that
          there was an attempt to group together and compare beers from around
          the world.[1] Jackson's book had a particular influence in North
          America where the writer Fred Eckhardt was also starting to explore
          the nature of beer styles. The wine importing company Merchant du
          Vin switched to importing beers mentioned in Jackson's book. Small
          brewers started up, producing copies and interpretations of the beer
          styles Jackson described. While North America developed beer styles
          into a serious study with fixed parameters of bitterness, colour,
          aroma, yeast, ingredients and strength, other countries continued to
          mainly categorise beers loosely by strength and colour, with much
          overlapping of naming conventions.

        <h5>History of beer styles</h5>
        <p>
          Yeasts that ferment at warmer temperatures, usually between 15.5 and
          24 째C (60 and 75 째F), form a layer of foam on the surface of the
          fermenting beer, which is why they are referred to as top-fermenting
          yeasts. Yeasts that ferment at considerably lower temperatures,
          around 10 째C (50 째F), have the ability to process a chemical
          compound known as raffinose, a complex sugar created during
          fermentation. These yeasts collect at the bottom of the fermenting
          beer and are therefore referred to as bottom-fermenting yeast. The
          majority of beer in production today is fermented in this way and is
          called lager.[7] Beers of spontaneous fermentation produced in
          Belgium using wild strains of yeast are referred to as lambic.
