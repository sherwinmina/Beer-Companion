  <h3>Hops</h3>
      <p style={{ textIndent: "50px" }}>
        Hops are the flowers (also called seed cones or strobiles) of the hop
        plant Humulus lupulus.[1] They are used primarily as a flavoring and
        stability agent in beer, to which they impart bitter, zesty, or citric
        flavours;[2] though they are also used for various purposes in other
        beverages and herbal medicine. The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing,
        herbaceous perennial, usually trained to grow up strings in a field
        called a hopfield, hop garden (nomenclature in the South of England),
        or hop yard (in the West Country and U.S.) when grown commercially.
        Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the
        world, with different types being used for particular styles of beer.
        The first documented use of hops in beer is from the 9th century,
        though Hildegard of Bingen, 300 years later, is often cited as the
        earliest documented source.[3] Before this period, brewers used gruit,
        composed of a wide variety of bitter herbs and flowers, including
        dandelion, burdock root, marigold, horehound (the old German name for
        horehound, Berghopfen, means "mountain hops"), ground ivy, and
        heather.[4] Early documents include mention of a hop garden in the
        will of Charlemagne's father, Pepin III.[5] In addition to adding
        flavor to beer, hops are also used in brewing for their antibacterial
        effect over less desirable microorganisms and for many purported
        benefits, including balancing the sweetness of the malt with
        bitterness, contributing a variety of desirable flavors and aromas.[2]
        Historically, traditional herb combinations for beers were believed to
        have been abandoned when beers made with hops were noticed to be less
        prone to spoilage.[6]

      <h5>History</h5>
      <p style={{ textIndent: "50px" }}>
        The first documented hop cultivation was in 736, in the Hallertau
        region of present-day Germany, although the first mention of the use
        of hops in brewing in that country was 1079.[7] However, in a will of
        Pepin the Short, the father of Charlemagne, hop gardens were left to
        the Cloister of Saint-Denis in 768. Not until the 13th century did
        hops begin to start threatening the use of gruit for flavoring. Gruit
        was used when taxes were levied by the nobility on hops. Whichever was
        taxed made the brewer then quickly switch to the other. In Britain,
        hopped beer was first imported from Holland around 1400, yet hops were
        condemned as late as 1519 as a "wicked and pernicious weed".[8] In
        1471, Norwich, England, banned use of the plant in the brewing of ale
        ("beer" was the name for fermented malt liquors bittered with hops;
        only in recent times are the words often used as synonyms). In
        Germany, using hops was also a religious and political choice in the
        early 16th century. There was no tax on hops to be paid on the
        Catholic church, unlike on gruit, for which the Protestant preferred
        hopped beer.[9] Hops used in England were imported from France,
        Holland and Germany with import duty paid for those; it was not until
        1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England (Kent)
        when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by Dutch farmers.
        Therefore, in the hop industry there are many words which originally
        were Dutch words (see oast house). Hops were then grown as far north
        as Aberdeen, near breweries for infrastructure convenience. According
        to Thomas Tusser's 1557 Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry: "The
        hop for his profit I thus do exalt, It strengtheneth drink and it
        flavoureth malt; And being well-brewed long kept it will last, And
        drawing abide, if ye draw not too fast."[10] In England there were
        many complaints over the quality of imported hops, the sacks of which
        were often contaminated by stalks, sand or straw to increase their
        weight. As a result, in 1603, King James I approved an Act of
        Parliament banning the practice by which "the Subjects of this Realm
        have been of late years abused &c. to the Value of Â£20,000 yearly,
        besides the Danger of their Healths".[11] Hop cultivation was begun in
        the present-day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch
        farmers.[12] Before national alcohol prohibition, cultivation was
        mainly centered around New York, California, Oregon, and Washington.
        Problems with powdery mildew and downy mildew devastated New York's
        production by the 1920s, and California only produces hops on a small
        scale.[13] Hop bars were used before modern machinery was invented to
        make the holes for the hop poles.[14]

      <h5>World production</h5>
      <p>
        Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates, with much
        of the world's production occurring near the 48th parallel north. Hop
        plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading
        potato-growing states in the United States are also major
        hops-producing areas;[15] however, not all potato-growing areas can
        produce good hops naturally: soils in the Maritime Provinces of
        Canada, for example, lack the boron that hops prefer.[15]
        Historically, hops were not grown in Ireland, but were imported from
        England. In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported
        through Dublin alone.[16] Important production centers today are the
        Hallertau in Germany (more hop-growing area than any other country as
        of 2006),[17] the Yakima (Washington) and Willamette (Oregon) valleys,
        and western Canyon County, Idaho (including the communities of Parma,
        Wilder, Greenleaf, and Notus).[18] The principal production centers in
        the UK are in Kent which produces Kent Goldings hops, Herefordshire
        and Worcestershire.[19][20] Essentially all of the harvested hops are
        used in beer making.

      <h5>Cultivation and Harvest</h5>
      <p>
        Although hops are grown in most of the continental United States and
        Canada,[22] cultivation of hops for commercial production requires a
        particular environment. As hops are a climbing plant, they are trained
        to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the
        plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same
        sunlight profile. In this way, energy that would have been required to
        build structural cells is also freed for crop growth.[23][citation
        needed] Male and female flowers of the hop plant usually develop on
        separate plants (that is, the plant is dioecious), although fertile
        monoecious individuals appear occasionally. Because viable seeds are
        undesirable for brewing beer, only female plants are grown in hop
        fields, thus preventing pollination. Female plants are propagated
        vegetatively, and male plants are culled if plants are grown from
        seeds.[24] Hop plants are planted in rows about 2 to 2.5 metres (7 to
        8 ft) apart. Each spring, the roots send forth new bines that are
        started up strings from the ground to an overhead trellis. The cones
        grow high on the bine, and in the past, these cones were picked by
        hand. Harvesting of hops became much more efficient with the invention
        of the mechanical hops separator, patented by Emil Clemens Horst in
        1909. Harvest comes near the end of summer when the bines are pulled
        down and the flowers are taken to a hop house or oast house for
        drying. Hop houses are two-story buildings, of which the upper story
        has a slatted floor covered with burlap. Here the flowers are poured
        out and raked even. A heating unit on the lower floor is used to dry
        the hops. When dry, the hops are moved to a press, a sturdy box with a
        plunger. Two long pieces of burlap are laid into the hop press at
        right angles, the hops are poured in and compressed into bales. Hop
        cones contain different oils, such as lupulin, a yellowish, waxy
        substance, an oleoresin, that imparts flavor and aroma to beer.[25]
        Lupulin contains lupulone and humulone, which possess antibiotic
        properties, suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer's yeast to
        grow. After lupulin has been extracted in the brewing process the
        papery cones are discarded.
